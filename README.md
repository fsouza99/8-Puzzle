# 8-Puzzle
The 8-Puzzle, written in Python 3.9.2.

Instructions are pretty simple, use a random board configuration or insert you own. In the latter case, make sure your game is solvable, because it is not the case that all board configurations can be solved. You can set a limit for iterations.

The code can be easily converted to the 4x4 version of this game (15-Puzzle).
